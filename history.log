SCIFLOW API: PROJECT DEVELOPMENT LOG (COMPLETE 174 STEPS)

PHASE 1: PROBLEM DEFINITION & STRATEGY

1. PROMPT: identify the main pain point for researchers looking for conferences
RESPONSE: It's fragmentation. Calls for papers (CFPs) are scattered across mailing lists, static sites (WikiCFP), and publisher portals. Researchers miss deadlines because there's no single "source of truth" that also links to the actual papers.

2. PROMPT: explain how we are different from google scholar
RESPONSE: Google Scholar is great for finding *past* papers. Sciflow focuses on the *future*—upcoming conferences, deadlines, and the social signal of "who else is going?" We bridge discovery with planning.

3. PROMPT: define the specific user personas for the app
RESPONSE: Two core personas: The "Active Submitter" (PhD students/Postdocs looking for CFPs to publish in) and the "Attendee" (Senior researchers looking for high-quality events to network at).

4. PROMPT: list the reasons why organizers would use this platform
RESPONSE: Visibility. New conferences struggle to get submissions. We give them a platform to claim their event, upload their banner, and directly link their accepted papers to build credibility.

5. PROMPT: decide on the single most important feature for the mvp
RESPONSE: "One-Click Sync." Finding a conference is one thing; remembering the deadline is another. Integrating with Google Calendar so the abstract submission deadline shows up on their phone is key.

6. PROMPT: check if scraping conference metadata is legal
RESPONSE: We shouldn't scrape content we don't own (like full PDFs). We'll aggregate public metadata (titles, dates, locations) and surface *links* to the papers. That's fair use.

7. PROMPT: design a system to prevent spam conference listings
RESPONSE: We need a "Verified Organizer" role. Anyone can view, but only verified accounts can create/edit events. Plus, users can "Rate" conferences, so spam gets downvoted quickly.

8. PROMPT: define the exact inputs and outputs for the search api
RESPONSE: Input: "Machine Learning" + "Europe" + "July 2026". Output: A list of Conference objects sorted by "Interest Count" so the most popular ones float to the top.

9. PROMPT: investigate if we can pull in real time rss feeds
RESPONSE: Yes, we can fetch from sources like dev.events or arXiv feeds. We'll need a background worker to parse these XMLs and merge them into our DB without creating duplicates.

10. PROMPT: model the data structure for co located workshops
RESPONSE: Self-referential relationship. A Conference can have a `parent_id` or a `colocated_with` list pointing to other Conference IDs.

PHASE 2: API ARCHITECTURE & DATA MODELING

11. PROMPT: create the database schema for the conference table
RESPONSE: Needs: `id`, `name`, `acronym` (e.g., CVPR), `start_date`, `end_date`, `location`, `topics` (array), `url`, and `organizer_id`.

12. PROMPT: add a user model with role support
RESPONSE: Standard fields: email, password_hash. Plus a `role` enum: "user" (default) or "organizer". And `google_refresh_token` for the calendar feature.

13. PROMPT: design the paper model and link it to the conference
RESPONSE: `Paper` belongs to `Conference`. Fields: `title`, `authors`, `abstract`, `pdf_url`, `published_at`.

14. PROMPT: standardise the rest api url structure
RESPONSE: Plural. `GET /conferences`, `POST /conferences`, `GET /conferences/{id}/papers`. Keeps it standard.

15. PROMPT: choose the authentication method for the api
RESPONSE: OAuth2 with Password Flow (Bearer tokens). It's the FastAPI standard, works great with React, and secure enough for our needs.

16. PROMPT: decide between uuids and integers for primary keys
RESPONSE: Let's stick to Auto-Increment Integers for now. Easier to debug `conference_id=5` than a long UUID string during dev. We can switch if we scale massively.

17. PROMPT: create a many to many relationship for user interests
RESPONSE: Yes, a join table `user_interests` linking `user_id` and `conference_id`. Simple toggle logic.

18. PROMPT: add a rating model with a 1 to 5 scale
RESPONSE: `Rating` model: `user_id`, `conference_id`, `score` (1-5). We'll need an aggregation query to show "Average Rating" on the frontend.

19. PROMPT: design the notification system structure
RESPONSE: `Notification` model. When an organizer `POST /papers`, we trigger a function to insert a Notification record for every user following that conference.

20. PROMPT: create strict pydantic schemas for validation
RESPONSE: `ConferenceCreate` should require name and start_date. `ConferenceRead` should include the calculated `average_rating` and `interest_count`.

21. PROMPT: handle optional fields like image urls in the schema
RESPONSE: Default to `None` in the Pydantic model. On the frontend, if it's null, we show a cool generative placeholder based on the conference topic.

22. PROMPT: implement a fast search endpoint
RESPONSE: `GET /conferences?q=...`. We'll use SQLAlchemy's `ilike` for case-insensitive partial matching on Title and Acronym.

23. PROMPT: add a database model for comments
RESPONSE: Simple `Comment` model: `content`, `user_id`, `conference_id`, `created_at`. No nesting for now, just a linear feed.

24. PROMPT: decide how to store timezones in the db
RESPONSE: Store everything in UTC in the DB. The frontend converts to the user's local browser time.

25. PROMPT: define how the api should handle 404 errors
RESPONSE: If `get_conference(id)` returns None, raise `HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Conference not found")`.

PHASE 3: BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION (FastAPI)

26. PROMPT: set up the basic fastapi app structure
RESPONSE: `app = FastAPI()`. Setup `main.py` and a `routers/` folder. I want this modular from day one.

27. PROMPT: configure the sqlite database connection
RESPONSE: Yes, `sqlite:///./sciflow.db`. Use `databases` (async) + `SQLAlchemy`. We need `aiosqlite` driver for async/await.

28. PROMPT: build the login route and token generation
RESPONSE: `POST /token`. Verify email/password. Use `passlib` to verify hash. Return a JWT access token.

29. PROMPT: create the get current user dependency
RESPONSE: Checks the `Authorization: Bearer ...` header. Decodes JWT. if invalid -> 401. If valid -> returns User object.

30. PROMPT: add a permission check for organizers
RESPONSE: Wraps `get_current_user`. Checks `if user.role != "organizer": raise 403`.

31. PROMPT: implement the crud endpoints for conferences
RESPONSE: `POST /conferences` (organizers only). `GET /conferences` (public). `PUT /conferences/{id}` (organizer only, check ownership).

32. PROMPT: add pagination to the conference list endpoint
RESPONSE: Add `skip` and `limit` query params to `GET /conferences`. Default `limit=20`.

33. PROMPT: write the function to parse the rss feed
RESPONSE: `xml.etree.ElementTree`. Fetch `https://dev.events/rss.xml`. Map their `<title>` to our `name`.

34. PROMPT: implement logic to merge db and rss results
RESPONSE: Fetch DB items. Fetch RSS items. Convert RSS items to Pydantic objects. Return `db_list + rss_list`.

35. PROMPT: create a utility to fix the rss date format
RESPONSE: Need a helper utility `parse_rss_date(date_str)`. `datetime.strptime` is our friend here.

36. PROMPT: integrate the google calendar oauth flow
RESPONSE: We need `google-auth-oauthlib`. The flow is: User clicks "Sync" -> Redirect to Google -> Google calls back to `/auth/callback` -> We get a refresh token -> Save to User DB.

37. PROMPT: write the code to insert events into the user calendar
RESPONSE: Use `google-api-python-client`. `service.events().insert(calendarId='primary', body={...})`. Run this when they click "Add to Calendar".

38. PROMPT: create the endpoint for uploading papers
RESPONSE: `POST /conferences/{id}/papers`. Accepts title and URL. Validates URL format. Checks if user owns the conference.

39. PROMPT: automate notification creation on new paper upload
RESPONSE: Inside the `create_paper` function, running a query: `SELECT user_id FROM interests WHERE conference_id = ...`. Then bulk insert Notifications for them.

40. PROMPT: ensure users can only rate a conference once
RESPONSE: If I rate again, it should update my old rating, not create a new one. `session.merge` or check existing -> update/insert.

41. PROMPT: add user rating status to the conference details response
RESPONSE: In the `ConferenceRead` response, can we include `user_rating`? Yes, if the user is logged in, specific query for that.

42. PROMPT: configure cors to allow the frontend port
RESPONSE: `CORSMiddleware`. `allow_origins=["http://localhost:5173"]`. `allow_methods=["*"]`.

43. PROMPT: decide how to handle image uploads
RESPONSE: Let's stick to URLs for now. Or, simplistic `StaticFiles` mounting. `app.mount("/static", ...)` and an upload endpoint that saves bytes to disk.

44. PROMPT: set up secure password hashing
RESPONSE: `pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")`. Never store plain text.

45. PROMPT: create a route to fetch the current organizers conferences
RESPONSE: `GET /conferences/mine`. Filter `query(Conference).filter(Conference.organizer_id == current_user.id)`.

46. PROMPT: create a route to fetch the users interested conferences
RESPONSE: `GET /interests`. Join `Conference` table where `Interest.user_id == current_user.id`.

47. PROMPT: strip the password hash from the user profile response
RESPONSE: Pydantic `response_model=UserRead`. `UserRead` excludes `hashed_password`.

48. PROMPT: implement a global error handler for clean responses
RESPONSE: Wrap DB calls in `try...except`. Catch `IntegrityError` (like duplicate email) and raise 400.

49. PROMPT: add a health check route for monitoring
RESPONSE: `GET /health`. Return `{"status": "ok"}`. Good for deployment checks later.

50. PROMPT: fix the n 1 query problem in the list endpoint
RESPONSE: Use `options(selectinload(Conference.organizer))`. Eager load related data.

PHASE 4: FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT (React + Vite)

51. PROMPT: initialize the react project with vite
RESPONSE: `npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react`. Clean up the boilerplate CSS.

52. PROMPT: define the css strategy for the project
RESPONSE: Let's go custom CSS with CSS variables for theming. It's lighter and gives us full control over the "Premium" scientific look.

53. PROMPT: configure axios for api requests
RESPONSE: `axios.create({ baseURL: ... })`. Add an interceptor to automatically inject `Authorization: Bearer <token>` from local storage.

54. PROMPT: create the auth context for global state
RESPONSE: `AuthContext`. `login()`, `logout()`, `user` object. Wrap the whole `App` in `<AuthProvider>`.

55. PROMPT: build the responsive navbar component
RESPONSE: Needs to be responsive. "Home", "My Conferences" (if organizer), "My Interests" (if researcher), "Login/Logout".

56. PROMPT: build the home page with the discovery feed
RESPONSE: A grid of cards. `useStats` hook to fetch data. `useEffect` to trigger search when the query changes.

57. PROMPT: design the conference card component
RESPONSE: Needs to pop. If there's an image, show it. If not, generated gradient. Title, Date, Rating stars, "Interest" heart button.

58. PROMPT: implement the follow button logic
RESPONSE: Optimistic UI update. Click -> Turn red immediately -> Send API req. If API fails, revert to grey and toast error.

59. PROMPT: create the conference detail page layout
RESPONSE: `/conference/:id`. Big hero header. Tabs for "Details", "Papers", "Discussion".

60. PROMPT: build the papers tab UI
RESPONSE: List of papers. Title, Authors, "Read PDF" button (opens in new tab). If organizer, provide "Add Paper" form here.

61. PROMPT: build the discussion tab UI
RESPONSE: Simple list of comments. Textarea at top to add new.

62. PROMPT: implement the login and signup forms
RESPONSE: Centered forms. Glassmorphism effect. Validation feedback (e.g., "Password too short").

63. PROMPT: add role selection to the signup flow
RESPONSE: Radio buttons? "I am a: Researcher / Event Organizer". Sets the `role` enum in the payload.

64. PROMPT: build the create conference wizard
RESPONSE: Multi-step wizard? No, huge single form is fine. Name, Dates, Location, Topics.

65. PROMPT: create a chip input component for topics
RESPONSE: Let's do a "Chip" input. Type "AI", hit enter -> creates a badge. Send as array or CSV string to backend.

66. PROMPT: build the my interests dashboard
RESPONSE: Similar to Home, but filtered. Maybe a "Calendar View" here later? For now, list view.

67. PROMPT: build the organizer dashboard
RESPONSE: Table view. Columns: Name, Date, # Papers, # Interests. Actions: Edit, Delete.

68. PROMPT: add the notification bell to the navbar
RESPONSE: Bell icon in Navbar. Red dot if `unread_count > 0`. Dropdown shows list. Click -> mark read -> go to conference.

69. PROMPT: create an interactive star rating component
RESPONSE: 5 stars. Hover fills them. Click sets the state. Send `POST /ratings`.

70. PROMPT: add the sync to google button
RESPONSE: "Add to Calendar". If `user.google_connected` is false, redirect to auth flow. If true, trigger sync.

71. PROMPT: implement protected routes for authenticated pages
RESPONSE: `<ProtectedRoute>` component. If `!user`, `<Navigate to="/login" />`.

72. PROMPT: add skeleton loaders for data fetching
RESPONSE: Skeleton loaders. Grey boxes pulsing while data fetches. Better UX than a spinning wheel.

73. PROMPT: set up a global toast notification system
RESPONSE: Global toast system. `api.interceptors.response.use(..., error => toast.error(error.message))`.

74. PROMPT: debounce the search input to save api calls
RESPONSE: Don't hit API on every keystroke. `useDebounce(searchTerm, 500ms)`.

75. PROMPT: make the layout mobile responsive
RESPONSE: Grid becomes 1 column on mobile. Navbar collapses to hamburger menu.

76. PROMPT: add a dark mode toggle
RESPONSE: `data-theme="dark"` attribute on `<body>`. Toggle in Navbar. Persist to localStorage.

77. PROMPT: add error handling for broken images
RESPONSE: `img onError={() => setSrc('/default-placeholder.png')}`.

PHASE 5: REFINEMENT & INTEGRATION

78. PROMPT: fix the display of colocated events
RESPONSE: If a conference has children, show them as "Related Events" sidebar.

79. PROMPT: add a filter to the papers list
RESPONSE: Add local search/filter within the papers tab. "Filter by author..."

80. PROMPT: format the date strings in the ui
RESPONSE: Use `Intl.DateTimeFormat`. Display "Feb 20, 2026".

81. PROMPT: clean up the backend router imports
RESPONSE: Group them. `app.include_router(conferences.router)` etc.

82. PROMPT: write the readme file
RESPONSE: Instructions for `npm run dev` and `uvicorn app.main:app`.

83. PROMPT: create a dockerfile for the backend
RESPONSE: Multi-stage build? Or keep it simple. Python 3.9 image. `pip install -r requirements.txt`. `CMD ["uvicorn", ...]`.

84. PROMPT: generate the requirements txt file
RESPONSE: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. Remove the local path references.

85. PROMPT: verify the paper submission flow
RESPONSE: Login as Organizer -> Create Conf -> Add Paper. Login as Researcher -> View Conf -> See Paper. Works.

86. PROMPT: prevent users from spamming ratings
RESPONSE: Fixed backend logic to UPSERT (update if exists).

87. PROMPT: filter out old rss feed items
RESPONSE: We filter RSS items by date in the merge logic. `if item.date < now: continue`.

88. PROMPT: audit the user profile response for privacy
RESPONSE: Checked `UserRead`. Email is included (needed for profile), but mostly harmless. Removed sensitive IDs.

89. PROMPT: optimize the home page performance
RESPONSE: Implemented Virtualization (React Window) or just pagination. Pagination is safer for backend load.

90. PROMPT: implement a copy to clipboard feature
RESPONSE: Copies `window.location.href` to clipboard. Toast "Link copied!".

91. PROMPT: design a custom 404 page
RESPONSE: User visits `/random/url`. Show a nice illustration and "Go Home" button.

92. PROMPT: design a text logo for the header
RESPONSE: Simple CSS text logo. "SciFlow" with a blue/purple gradient.

93. PROMPT: create the footer component
RESPONSE: Copyright 2026. Links to "Terms" and "Privacy".

94. PROMPT: add a terms of service checkbox to signup
RESPONSE: Checkbox "I agree to Terms". Disabled "Sign Up" button until checked.

95. PROMPT: pre fill the edit conference form
RESPONSE: The `defaultValue` in inputs needs to come from the fetched data. Use `useEffect` to reset form when data arrives.

96. PROMPT: add a delete confirmation modal
RESPONSE: Scary. Add a confirmation modal. "Are you sure? This will delete all papers too."

97. PROMPT: create an empty state for my conferences
RESPONSE: "You haven't created any conferences yet. [Create One]" button.

98. PROMPT: create an empty state for my interests
RESPONSE: "You haven't followed any conferences. Go explore!"

99. PROMPT: create an admin dashboard
RESPONSE: Maybe later. For now, DB admin is enough.

100. PROMPT: prepare environment variables for production
RESPONSE: `VITE_API_URL` for frontend. `DATABASE_URL` for backend. `SECRET_KEY` for JWT.

PHASE 6: POLISHING & FINAL TOUCHES

101. PROMPT: rewrite the hero text to be more engaging
RESPONSE: "Discover the Future of Science. Track conferences, find papers, never miss a beat."

102. PROMPT: add hover effects to the conference cards
RESPONSE: `transform: scale(1.02)` on hover. Shadow deepens. Makes it feel tactile.

103. PROMPT: center the loading spinner
RESPONSE: CSS `place-items: center` on the container.

104. PROMPT: style the form validation messages
RESPONSE: Red-500 for errors. Green-500 for success. Standard semantic colors.

105. PROMPT: add a password strength indicator
RESPONSE: Simple progress bar. Length > 8 ? +33%. Has number ? +33%. Has Special char ? +33%.

106. PROMPT: custom style the date picker
RESPONSE: Browser default date picker is okay, but styled poorly. Added some CSS to make it consistent with the theme.

107. PROMPT: add tooltips to action icons
RESPONSE: Hover over the star -> "Rate this". Hover over heart -> "Follow".

108. PROMPT: decide between load more and infinite scroll
RESPONSE: "Load More" button is better for footer accessibility.

109. PROMPT: check contrast ratios for accessibility
RESPONSE: Dark mode text was too grey. Lightened it to `#e5e7eb` for better readability.

110. PROMPT: generate a favicon
RESPONSE: Generated a little beaker icon.

111. PROMPT: choose a font family
RESPONSE: "Inter" font family. Clean, modern, scientific.

112. PROMPT: standardize the spacing units
RESPONSE: Using REM units everywhere. 1rem = 16px. Margins are multiples of 0.5rem.

113. PROMPT: remove console logs from the code
RESPONSE: Removed `console.log('here')` debugging leftovers.

114. PROMPT: investigate double fetches in dev mode
RESPONSE: `React.Strict` mode causes double invoke in dev. This is normal, but verified it's single in production build.

115. PROMPT: add database indexes for performance
RESPONSE: Added index on `conference_id` in Papers table for fast lookups.

116. PROMPT: add a cta buffer to the landing page
RESPONSE: Added to the bottom of the landing page.

117. PROMPT: add basic seo meta tags
RESPONSE: `<meta name="description" content="...">`. Helmet in React.

118. PROMPT: configure open graph tags for sharing
RESPONSE: Added OpenGraph metatags so it looks good on Twitter/Slack.

119. PROMPT: fix the mobile menu click behavior
RESPONSE: When I click a link in the mobile menu, it should close the menu. Added that logic.

120. PROMPT: add a back to top button
RESPONSE: Floats in bottom right when scrolled down.

121. PROMPT: implement an error boundary component
RESPONSE: "Something went wrong" full page error if the whole app explodes.

122. PROMPT: implement draft saving for forms
RESPONSE: LocalStorage save. If I reload, form data persists.

123. PROMPT: add page transition animations
RESPONSE: Framer Motion `<AnimatePresence>`. Fade in/out between routes.

124. PROMPT: distinguish external links visually
RESPONSE: Visually distinguish links that go to other sites (Papers) vs internal links.

125. PROMPT: allow users to edit their profile
RESPONSE: Allow user to update Name/Email.

126. PROMPT: implement the logout logic
RESPONSE: Clear local storage, redirect to Home.

127. PROMPT: handle token expiration gracefully
RESPONSE: If API returns 401, auto-logout and redirect to login.

128. PROMPT: add a forgot password placeholder
RESPONSE: Just a placeholder for now. "Contact Admin".

129. PROMPT: handle empty search results
RESPONSE: "No conferences found matching 'xyz'. Try a broader term."

130. PROMPT: support markdown in conference descriptions
RESPONSE: Markdown support. `react-markdown` package. Allows bold/lists in descriptions.

131. PROMPT: add google analytics tracking
RESPONSE: Google Analytics basic tracking script added to `index.html`.

132. PROMPT: fix the rating update delay bug
RESPONSE: Invalidate the cache/refetch the conference details after rating submission.

133. PROMPT: add a verified badge for organizers
RESPONSE: Gold checkmark next to organizer names.

134. PROMPT: enable info level logging
RESPONSE: `logging.INFO` for all requests. Helps debug "why did this 400?".

135. PROMPT: update dependencies to latest versions
RESPONSE: Bump `fastapi` to latest patch version.

136. PROMPT: disable actions for guest users
RESPONSE: Hide "Rate" and "Follow" buttons if not logged in. Show "Login to interact" tooltip.

137. PROMPT: validate paper urls
RESPONSE: Ensure URL starts with `http://` or `https://`.

138. PROMPT: add a new badge for recent conferences
RESPONSE: If `created_at` < 7 days ago, show "NEW" badge.

139. PROMPT: add a skeleton screen for details page
RESPONSE: Layout match (Header block, Body text block) to reduce layout shift.

140. PROMPT: check for sql injection vulnerabilities
RESPONSE: SQLAlchemy handles parameter binding. We are safe.

141. PROMPT: implement rate limiting for login
RESPONSE: Add simple limiter to Login route. 5 attempts per minute.

142. PROMPT: add a report conference button
RESPONSE: Mailto link to support email with conference ID in subject.

143. PROMPT: generate ics files for calendar export
RESPONSE: Alternative to Google Sync. Generate .ics string on client side.

144. PROMPT: improve the visual hierarchy of the page
RESPONSE: H1 for Title, H2 for Sections. Text-gray-500 for secondary info.

145. PROMPT: add a trending sort option
RESPONSE: Sort by number of interests descending.

146. PROMPT: make the navbar sticky
RESPONSE: Navbar stays fixed at top with blur backdrop.

147. PROMPT: fix z index layout issues
RESPONSE: Set Modal z-index to 50, Navbar to 40.

148. PROMPT: add fields for keynote speakers
RESPONSE: Added text field for "Keynote Speakers" to Conference model.

149. PROMPT: add a series field to group conferences
RESPONSE: To group "CVPR 2025" and "CVPR 2026".

150. PROMPT: perform a smoke test for deployment
RESPONSE: Does the build pass? Yes.

PHASE 7: FINAL DEPLOYMENT PREP (Service Integration)

151. PROMPT: create the render blueprint file
RESPONSE: Good call. Blueprint file. Backend service (Python), Frontend service (Static), Database (Postgres).

152. PROMPT: set the backend start command
RESPONSE: `gunicorn app.main:app -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`. Production grade server.

153. PROMPT: map the environment variables in render
RESPONSE: Map `DATABASE_URL` from the db service. `FRONTEND_URL` from static site.

154. PROMPT: set the frontend build command
RESPONSE: `npm install && npm run build`. Serves from `dist/`.

155. PROMPT: update the db connection string for postgres
RESPONSE: SQLite works locally, but Render gives us `postgres://`. Need to replace with `postgresql+asyncpg://` logic.

156. PROMPT: add production dependencies
RESPONSE: And `asyncpg` for the driver. Essential for prod.

157. PROMPT: configure the api url for production
RESPONSE: `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`. In `render.yaml`, set this to the backend service URL.

158. PROMPT: whitelist the production url in cors
RESPONSE: Allow the `FRONTEND_URL` env var in the origin list.

159. PROMPT: test the docker build locally
RESPONSE: `docker build`. Check image size.

160. PROMPT: set the node engine version
RESPONSE: Specify Node version >= 18.

161. PROMPT: add a procfile for heroku compatibility
RESPONSE: Not needed for Render if we use `render.yaml`, but good practice for Heroku.

162. PROMPT: freeze the requirements versions
RESPONSE: Freeze exact versions to ensure reproducibility.

163. PROMPT: verify clipboard functionality over https
RESPONSE: Navigator API requires HTTPS. Render provides SSL by default, so we're good.

164. PROMPT: decide on database migration strategy
RESPONSE: Run `alembic upgrade head`? Or just `Base.metadata.create_all` on startup. For this MVP, startup create is fine.

165. PROMPT: design a maintenance mode page
RESPONSE: If backend is down, frontend shows "System upgrading".

166. PROMPT: configure asset compression
RESPONSE: Vite does minification. `gzipped` assets.

167. PROMPT: configure cache busting
RESPONSE: Vite appends usage hash to filenames `index.a4b2.js`. Browser caching won't show stale code.

168. PROMPT: perform user acceptance testing
RESPONSE: Walkthrough the whole "Researcher Journey". Search -> Filter -> Click -> Read Paper. Feels smooth.

169. PROMPT: test the organizer workflow
RESPONSE: Login -> Dashboard -> Edit Conference -> Save. Updates reflected immediately.

170. PROMPT: check mobile usability
RESPONSE: Hamburger menu works. Tap targets are big enough.

171. PROMPT: update the documentation
RESPONSE: Added "Deployment" section to README.

172. PROMPT: launch the verified system
RESPONSE: All systems go. Codebase clean. Deployment config ready. Sciflow V2 is live.

173. PROMPT: configure render with the free plan
RESPONSE: Added `plan: free` to `render.yaml` to ensure no costs for the user.
